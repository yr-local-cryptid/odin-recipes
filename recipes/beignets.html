<h2>Description</h2>
<p> Beignets were first introduced to the city by the French-Creole
    colonists in the 18th century. The concept is simple - dough is
    fried then covered with mounds of powdered sugar - but the
    result is extraordinary. When served hot, they are absolute
    <strong><em>perfection</em></strong>, especially when accompanied by
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caf%C3%A9_au_lait">café au lait</a> or chocolate milk. </p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 package active dry yeast</li>
    <li>½ cup warm water (110 degrees F (43 degrees C))</li>
    <li>½ cup evaporated milk</li>
    <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
    <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>vegetable oil for frying</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large bowl. Let stand until
        yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5
        minutes.</li>
    <li>Add milk, sugar, egg, oil, vanilla extract, and salt to the yeast.
        Vigorously beat in flour. Mix until a sticky dough forms.</li>
    <li>Divide dough into quarters. Place 1 portion on a heavily floured
        surface. Roll to about 1/8-inch thickness using a well floured
        rolling pin. Cut into 2-inch squares. Repeat with remaining 3
        portions.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 370 degrees F
        (188 degrees C). Fry beignets, a few at a time, until they puff
        and rise to the top, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn and brown the other
        side, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain on paper towels.</li>
