<h2>Description</h2>
<p> Beignets were first introduced to the city by the French-Creole
    colonists in the 18th century. The concept is simple - dough is
    fried then covered with mounds of powdered sugar - but the
    result is extraordinary. When served hot, they are absolute
    <strong>perfection</strong>, especially when accompanied by
    caf√© au lait or chocolate milk. </p>
