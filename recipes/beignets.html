<h2>Description</h2>
<p> Beignets were first introduced to the city by the French-Creole
    colonists in the 18th century. The concept is simple - dough is
    fried then covered with mounds of powdered sugar - but the
    result is extraordinary. When served hot, they are absolute
    <strong><em>perfection</em></strong>, especially when accompanied by
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caf%C3%A9_au_lait">café au lait</a> or chocolate milk. </p>
