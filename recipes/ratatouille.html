<h2>Description</h2>
<p>"Last night, I experienced something new: an extraordinary meal
    from a singularly unexpected source. To say that both the meal
    and its maker have challenged my preconceptions about fine cooking
    is a gross understatement. They have rocked me to my core.
    In the past, I have made no secret of my disdain for <a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/ratatouille/images/6/60/Auguste_Gusteau.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190505053545">Chef Gusteau's</a>
    famous motto, 'Anyone can cook.' But I realize, only now do I
    truly understand what he meant. Not everyone can become a great artist;
    but a great artist <strong>can</strong> come from <strong>anywhere</strong>.
    It is difficult to imagine more humble origins than those of the genius
    now cooking at Gusteau's, who is, in this critic's opinion, nothing less
    than the finest chef in France. I will be returning to Gusteau's soon,
    hungry for more. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
        <li>½ onion, chopped</li>
        <li>¼ cup minced garlic</li>
        <li>¾ cup water</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 small eggplant, trimmed and very thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 zucchini, trimmed and very thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 yellow squash, trimmed and very thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, cored and very thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 yellow bell pepper, cored and very thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves, or to taste</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons mascarpone cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Spread tomato paste onto the bottom of a 10-inch square
            baking dish. Sprinkle with onion and garlic. Stir in water
            and 1 tablespoon olive oil until thoroughly combined.
            Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Arrange alternating slices of eggplant, zucchini, yellow squash,
            red bell pepper, and yellow bell pepper, starting at the outer
            edge of the dish and working concentrically towards the center.
            Overlap slices a little to display colors.</li>
        <li>Drizzle vegetables with remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil; season
            with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with thyme leaves. Cover vegetables
            with a piece of parchment paper cut to fit inside.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until vegetables are roasted and tender,
            about 45 minutes. Serve with dollops of mascarpone cheese.</li>
