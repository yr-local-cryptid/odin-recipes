<h2>Description</h2>
<p>"Last night, I experienced something new: an extraordinary meal
    from a singularly unexpected source. To say that both the meal
    and its maker have challenged my preconceptions about fine cooking
    is a gross understatement. They have rocked me to my core.
    In the past, I have made no secret of my disdain for <a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/ratatouille/images/6/60/Auguste_Gusteau.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190505053545">Chef Gusteau's</a>
    famous motto, 'Anyone can cook.' But I realize, only now do I
    truly understand what he meant. Not everyone can become a great artist;
    but a great artist <strong>can</strong> come from <strong>anywhere</strong>.
    It is difficult to imagine more humble origins than those of the genius
    now cooking at Gusteau's, who is, in this critic's opinion, nothing less
    than the finest chef in France. I will be returning to Gusteau's soon,
    hungry for more. </p>
