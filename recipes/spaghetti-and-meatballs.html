<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Spaghetti and meatballs is an Italian-American dish consisting of
    spaghetti, tomato sauce and meatballs. Originally inspired by
    similar dishes from <a href="https://lifeinitaly.com/italian-regional-food-the-south/">southern Italy</a>, the modern version of
    spaghetti and meatballs was developed by Italian immigrants
    in the USA. However, combinations of pasta with meat date back at
    least to the Middle Ages, and pasta (including long pasta) dishes
    with tomato sauce and different kinds of meatballs are documented
    in certain Italian regions and in modern Italian cookbooks as
    <em>maccheroni alle polpette</em> (translated as "spaghetti with
    meatballs") and <em>maccheroni alla chitarra con polpette</em>,
    though these dishes are often found only in particular regions
    and towns.</p>
