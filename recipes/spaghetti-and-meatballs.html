<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Spaghetti and meatballs is an Italian-American dish consisting of
    spaghetti, tomato sauce and meatballs. Originally inspired by
    similar dishes from <a href="https://lifeinitaly.com/italian-regional-food-the-south/">southern Italy</a>, the modern version of
    spaghetti and meatballs was developed by Italian immigrants
    in the USA. However, combinations of pasta with meat date back at
    least to the Middle Ages, and pasta (including long pasta) dishes
    with tomato sauce and different kinds of meatballs are documented
    in certain Italian regions and in modern Italian cookbooks as
    <em>maccheroni alle polpette</em> (translated as "spaghetti with
    meatballs") and <em>maccheroni alla chitarra con polpette</em>,
    though these dishes are often found only in particular regions
    and towns.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>¾ cup chopped onion</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>2 (16 ounce) cans crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>3 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li>
    <li>1 cup water</li>
    <li>½ cup sugar</li>
    <li>¼ cup chopped fresh oregano, divided</li>
    <li>1 dried bay leaf</li>
    <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 pound ground round</li>
    <li>½ cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>
    <li>¼ cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
    <li>2 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
    <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>1 (16 ounce) package uncooked spaghetti</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat,
        and cook the onion until lightly brown. Mix in 2 cloves
        garlic, and cook 1 minute. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato
        paste, water, sugar, 1/2 the oregano, and bay leaf. Season
        with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low,
        and simmer while preparing meatballs.</li>
    <li>In a bowl, mix the ground round, bread crumbs, remaining oregano,
        remaining garlic, parsley, eggs, and cheese. Season with salt and
        pepper. Roll into 1 inch balls, and drop into the sauce. Cook
        40 minutes in the sauce, or until internal temperature of meatballs
        reaches a minimum of 160 degrees F (72 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil, and stir
        in the spaghetti. Cook 8 to 10 minutes, until al dente, and drain.
        Serve the meatballs and sauce over the cooked spaghetti.</li>
